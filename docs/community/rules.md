# Rules

At Digg, we're building communities that gather around shared interests. The internet has many platforms, and we've thoughtfully developed rules to help our community thrive. We believe in upholding a standard of integrity that sets us apart—which means Digg might not be for everyone, and we're okay with that.

That said, stagnation in thinking will be the death of us, so we're here to listen and modify them as we learn together. If you have suggestions for improvement, please share them—your perspective helps make Digg better for everyone.

We're excited to see what we'll build together with those who share our vision for more meaningful connection.

### 1. Respect Your Fellow Human
Our communities thrive when everyone can participate in a safe environment where healthy disagreement coexists with mutual respect. No harassment, bullying, hate speech, doxxing, discrimination, or advocating for violence. Content targeting people based on their identity or engaging in persistent negative behavior toward individuals or groups is prohibited.

### 2. Stay Legal
Operating within legal boundaries protects our community and ensures our platform's continued existence. Don't post, share, or coordinate anything that breaks the law. Illegal content or activities violate our [Terms of Service](https://docs.digg.com/terms).

### 3. Protect Kids
Safeguarding minors is a non-negotiable responsibility we all share. Don't share or encourage any sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving people under 18. All predatory behavior involving minors is prohibited without exception.

### 4. Be Yourself
Trust requires authenticity; deception undermines our community's foundation. You don't need to use your real name, but don't impersonate others or misrepresent yourself in misleading ways.

### 5. Honor Community Guidelines
Each community creates its own culture—respect the unique space you're entering, just as you would when visiting someone's home. Follow the specific rules established by each community you participate in, even if they differ from other spaces or your usual online behavior.

### 6. Engage Genuinely
Quality conversations require good faith participation; manipulation damages our shared spaces. Post authentic content where you have personal interest. Don't spam, artificially manipulate votes or engagement metrics, or deliberately disrupt communities. Creating alternate accounts to evade bans or circumvent moderation decisions is considered a violation.

### 7. Protect Privacy
What's shared online can have lasting real-world impacts that are impossible to undo. Never share someone else's personal information without permission or post intimate media without explicit consent. Don't use private information to harass or expose others.

### 8. Respect The Platform
We're building this space together; technical boundaries ensure everyone can enjoy it equally. Don't exploit platform features or interfere with normal site functionality, including attempts to circumvent moderation or security measures.

## What Will Digg Do If These Rules Are Broken?

We use a tiered approach to user conduct violations based on severity and frequency. Depending on the nature of the violation, we may take actions including:

- Content removal  
- Temporary restrictions on posting, commenting, or voting  
- Community-specific removal  
- Account warnings  
- Temporary account suspension  
- Permanent account suspension

Digg is working on a fully transparent moderation system that will be an industry first and visible to all, eliminating all shadow banning. We believe in transparency and accountability in content moderation, allowing users to understand exactly what actions were taken and why.
